In this rewritten version, PropertyChangeListener is used instead of Observer/Observable for achieving the observer pattern. The WeatherStation class now maintains a list of PropertyChangeListener instances and notifies them through the propertyChange method. The WeatherDisplay class implements PropertyChangeListener to receive updates.
